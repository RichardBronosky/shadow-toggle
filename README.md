There's nothing to install. Just click the [![Download ZIP](http://i.imgur.com/rfJY11a.png)](https://github.com/RichardBronosky/shadow-toggle/archive/master.zip) button on the right side of this GitHub repo page. Expand the zip in your ~/Downloads folder. The [shadow-toggle.sh](https://github.com/RichardBronosky/shadow-toggle/blob/master/shadow-toggle.sh) will report the current status of the shadow capturing preference and prompt you to change it. (The default is "Yes" so you can just hit enter twice when.) Run it again to reverse the change.
